## ✨ Why I'm Doing This

I'm transitioning into the Data Science and AI field, and CS50 is the perfect foundation for sharpening my logic, algorithms, and programming fluency in C, Python, and more. This repository serves as:

- 📂 A portfolio of my code
- 📈 A way to track my growth
- 🧠 A reflection of what I've learned

---

## 🚀 How to Explore

- Each folder (`week0`, `week1`, ...) contains code for that week's assignments and labs.
- Some folders will include:
  - ✅ My solutions
  - 💡 Key concepts
  - 📌 Reflections or challenges I faced

---

## 📌 Notes

- All solutions are **my own work** and follow the CS50 academic honesty policy.
- If you're a fellow student, feel free to use this as inspiration — but do your own work 😊
